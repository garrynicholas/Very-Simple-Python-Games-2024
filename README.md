# The Judgective

**The Judgective** is a simple Python game for beginners. It's a text-based game where you have to choose a suspect by collecting only three pieces of information: Occupation, Backstory, and Clue. If you fail to identify the right suspect, you get accused of being a corrupt authority and go to jail for several years.
