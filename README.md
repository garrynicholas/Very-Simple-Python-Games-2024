# Very-Simple-Python-Games-2024
This project is a simple Python game for beginners called "The Judgective." It's a text-based game where you choose a suspect by collecting 3 pieces of information: Occupation, Backstory, and Clue. If you fail to identify the right suspect, you get accused of being a corrupt authority and go to jail for several years.
